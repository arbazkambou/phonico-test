                    Information Collected by and/or Provided to Third
                    Parties&nbsp;We may obtain information about you and combine
                    it with your account information. For example, we may
                    receive information from the retailer from whom you
                    purchased a Phonico product prior to your commencing service
                    with us. In addition, we use a third-party service provider
                    to serve ads and/or collect data on our behalf across the
                    Internet and sometimes on this Web site. Some of these
                    service providers may collect information about your visits
                    to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and
                    services to tailor marketing messages on this Web site and
                    other sites or to trigger real time interaction, customize

                    information that you share with this site via a web form
                    automatically and prior to your pressing a submit button;

                    this site to send marketing messages to you in a way that
                    may personally identify you. This information is collected
                    through the use of a cookie, a javascript tag and/or pixel,
                    which is industry standard technology used by most major web
                    sites.&nbsp; The information collected by these service
                    providers may include your device’s IP address, user agent,

                    Location-Based Services&nbsp;We use location information to
                    route wireless communications and to provide 911 service,
                    which allows emergency services to locate your general
                    location. We may disclose, without your consent, the
                    approximate location of a wireless device to a governmental
                    entity or law enforcement authority when we are served with
                    lawful process or reasonably believe there is an emergency
                    involving risk of death or serious physical harm. Depending
                    on your device, you may also be able to obtain a wide array
                    of services based on the location of your device (for
                    example, driving directions, enhanced 411 Directory
                    Assistance or search results, etc.). These data services,
                    known as Location-Based Services (“LBS”) are made available
                    by us and other entities, usually via applications. These
                    services use various location technologies and acquire
                    location data from various sources. These applications and
                    services use various location technologies (including Global
                    Positioning Satellite (“GPS”), Assisted GPS (“AGPS”), cell
                    ID and enhanced cell ID technologies) to identify the
                    approximate location of a device, which is then used in
                    conjunction with the application to enhance the user’s
                    experience (for example, to provide driving directions, to
                    provide enhanced 411 Directory Assistance or search results,
                    etc.).LBS may, or may not, involve any interaction with or
                    dependency on our supplier’s network, and location-based
                    services may or may not look to our network to obtain
                    location data. Where our network supplier allows third
                    parties the capability of accessing data about your location
                    that is derived from our supplier’s network, our network
                    supplier requires those third parties to observe specific
                    privacy and security protections consistent with this
                    policy. It is important that you understand the location
                    capabilities and settings of your device, and that you
                    carefully read and understand the terms under which these
                    services are provided – whether by us or another entity. You
                    should carefully review the privacy policies and other terms
                    of third parties with whom you have authorized the sharing
                    of your location information, and you should consider the
                    risks involved in disclosing your location information to
                    other people. Where we provide a location-based service, you
                    will receive notice of the location features of the service
                    and collection of location data is with your consent. You
                    will be provided options for managing when and how such
                    information should be shared.&nbsp;

              inquiries; (vii) to manage and develop our business and
              operations, administer accounts, and collect and process payments;
              and (viii) if you authorize text messaging, we will use your
              mobile number to communicate with you about your account and to
              send marketing text messages to you. If you decide that you no
              longer wish to receive emails or text messages from Phonico Mobile
              that you had authorized, you may opt-out of receiving emails and
              text messages by managing your account preferences on this Site or
              by any other reasonable opt-out method available to you. Please
              note that Phonico may have to communicate with you about product
              or service orders that you choose to place. You cannot opt-out of
              receiving product or service-related emails. Phonico will not
              sell, rent, trade, license or otherwise disclose your specific
              personal information or financial information to third parties,
              except that: (1) Phonico uses third parties to perform specific
              functions on its behalf and it must disclose information to help
              those parties perform their services (for example, Phonico would
              disclose your name, address and phone number to a commercial
              carrier such as Federal Express or UPS in order to deliver a
              physical product that you order); (2) Phonico must disclose your
              name and credit card number and information to financial services
              and credit card processing companies in order to process your
              orders; (3) Phonico may be required to disclose such information
              in response to a legal process, order or investigation (for
              example, a subpoena or court order); (4) Phonico may disclose
              personal information where disclosure is necessary to protect its
              legal rights or to protect itself or others (for example, in order
              to reduce the risk of fraud or illegal activities); (5) Phonico
              may share such information amongst its affiliated companies for
              the purpose of marketing products and services to you; (6) Phonico
              Mobile may provide identity verification services to third parties
              and your personal information may be included in the data
              transferred to third parties in connection with those services;
              and (7) Phonico Mobile may acquire, merge with or be acquired by
              another company or it might sell some or all of its assets, and,
              in such a case, your personal information may be included in the
              transferred business assets. Also, in the event of our bankruptcy,
              insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the
              benefit of creditors, we may not be able to control how your
              personal information is treated, transferred, or used and your
              personal information may be included in the transferred assets.
              Phonico may sell, rent, trade, license, use and disclose all
              non-personal information and aggregate information, so long as
              such information does not personally identify you or any user, to
              any third party for any purpose, including, but not limited to,
              research and analytical purposes. Under federal law, you have a
              right, and Phonico has a duty, to protect the confidentiality of
              information regarding your telephone use, the services you
              purchase from us, the calls you place and the location of your
              device on our network when you make a telephone call. This
              information is referred to as, among other things, “Customer
              Proprietary Network Information.” We may share Customer
              Proprietary Network Information with our affiliates; provided,
              however, that we will first notify you of your rights under
              applicable law, describe how we intend to use the Customer
              Proprietary Network Information, and give you an opportunity to
              opt-out of such use (or opt-in, to the extent required by
              applicable law).

              <br />
              California Civil Code Section 1798 entitles California customers

              information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct
              marketing purposes. Phonico will not knowingly share your personal

              This Site does not currently respond to “Do Not Track” signals of
              web browsers. However, should the industry establish uniform
              technological standards for recognizing and implementing “Do Not

              standards.

              <br />
              Phonico does not knowingly solicit children to purchase services
              or products. If, however, you authorize a child to use our
              services or products by providing them a device associated with
              your Phonico account, any information associated with such use
              will be treated as your information in accordance with this
              Privacy Policy. This Site is not intended for children under the
              age of 13, and Phonico does not intentionally or knowingly collect
              personal information on this Site from anyone under the age of 13.
              We encourage parents to be involved in the online activities
              (including wireless Internet browsing) of their children to ensure
              that no information is collected from a child without parental
              permission.

              <strong>13. California Subscriber Rights</strong>
              <br />

              Code of Regulations, you have rights under the California Consumer
              Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”). A description of your rights and
              disclosures about how we process your personal information are
              below.
              <br />
              The CCPA gives California residents certain rights regarding their
              data, including:
              <br />
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The right to know the categories of personal information we’ve
                collected and the categories of sources from which we got the
                information (see Information collected by Phonico and the chart
                just below)
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                The right to know the business purposes for sharing personal
                information (see Why Phonico uses your information)
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                The right to know the categories of third parties with whom
                we’ve shared personal information (see Sharing your information)
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                The right to access the specific pieces of personal information
                we’ve collected and the right to delete your information (see

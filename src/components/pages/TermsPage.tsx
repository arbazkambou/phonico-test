                        This binding dispute resolution and arbitration process (the “ADR
                        Process”) shall also apply to any claims against other parties relating
                        to Service or Devices provided or billed to you (such as our suppliers,
                        Dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against
                        us in the same proceeding. This also includes any claims brought after
                        your service agreement with Phonico terminates. The ADR Process shall
                        survive the termination of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
                        the above phrase “any and all claims or disputes” includes any claims
                        under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which are also subject to
                        this ADR Process. As provided in Section 22 below, the Parties expressly
                        agree that the arbitration provisions, as embodied in this ADR Process,
                        shall be governed by federal law, including the Federal Arbitration Act
                        and federal case law interpreting the Federal Arbitration Act. For
                        purposes of enforcing any arbitration award, Phonico and you agree that
                        the exclusive venue shall be United States District Court, Central
                        District of California (the “Federal Court”), in the first instance, and
                        in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Orange, in
                        the event the Federal Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction or
                        diversity jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, please be advised
                        this Agreement affects interstate commerce, such that federal law would
                        preempt state law. To the extent allowed by law, you agree to waive any
                        argument that this Agreement does not affect interstate commerce.

                        CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL. TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW AND
                        TO THE EXTENT THE ADR PROCESS AND THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO
                        BE UNENFORCEABLE, Phonico AND YOU WAIVE STATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL

                        IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. THE
                        ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THIS AGREEMENT AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND

                        Prearbitration Dispute Resolution. Before initiating any arbitration
                        against Phonico, you must comply with this provision unless you have a
                        Puerto Rico address. For all disputes (except for Puerto Rico
                        customers), you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim
                        by calling our customer service department at (484)746-6426 and
                        providing a written description and supporting documentation of your
                        claim, if requested by the Phonico care agent. Phonico and you each
                        agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. If Phonico and you are
                        unable to resolve the claim within sixty (60) days after Phonico
                        receives your claim description and supporting documentation, you may
                        pursue your claim in arbitration.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Small claims option. As an alternative to arbitration, Phonico may
                        choose to resolve payment disputes in small claims court in the county
                        of your most recent billing address. Phonico and you agree that if you
                        fail to timely pay amounts due, Phonico may assign your account for
                        collection, and the collection agency may pursue, in small claims court,
                        claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due amounts and
                        any interest or cost of collection permitted by applicable law or the
                        Agreement.

                        <br />
                        Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings following the above
                        described 60-day period.&nbsp;You may submit a demand for arbitration
                        using one of the following arbitration services through their Orange
                        County, California office: (1) ADR Services, Orange County, California
                        and (2) Judicate West, Orange County, California. However, in all cases,
                        you must serve all necessary paperwork through our registered agent
                        pursuant to Section 12.4 of these T&amp;Cs.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        You and Phonico agree that the following rules will apply (the
                        “Arbitration Rules”), depending on which arbitration service provider
                        you select: (1) if ADR Services, the Arbitration Rules then in effect
                        with the ADR Services (available
                        at&nbsp;https://www.adrservices.com/services-2/arbitration-rules/) or
                        (2) if Judicate West, the “Commercial Arbitration Rules” (available at
                        https://www.judicatewest.com/Services/arbitration). lf for any reason
                        the arbitration service provider you select declines to administer the
                        Claim, you must submit your claim to the remaining arbitration service
                        provider. If both ADR Services and Judicate West decline to administer
                        the Claim, then you or Phonico may file a petition in Federal Court for
                        the appointment of an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. Section 5. Phonico
                        and you agree to arbitration before a single arbitrator (the
                        “Arbitrator”). The Arbitrator must be a retired judge or appellate
                        justice, but otherwise will be selected pursuant to the applicable
                        Arbitration Rules. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
                        22 or any state’s conflict of laws rules, in order to ensure the
                        availability of witnesses, the Arbitrator will sit in Orange County,
                        California, where Phonico is headquartered, unless your billing address
                        is in Puerto Rico, in which case the Arbitrator will sit in Puerto Rico.
                        If you live outside of Orange County, California, the Arbitrator shall
                        permit you to fully participate in the arbitration hearing by
                        videoconference, and the Arbitrator shall have discretion to allow any
                        party to fully participate in the hearing by videoconference upon
                        request. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that the ADR Process
                        is more accessible than a court trial and that you are not dissuaded
                        from bringing a legitimate claim because you need to personally attend
                        court proceedings. In all cases, the Arbitration Rules shall apply,
                        except as modified by the Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
                        contrary in the Arbitration Rules, Phonico voluntarily agrees to the
                        following: if the dispute involves less than $75,000.00, and you agree
                        to limit your maximum recovery to $75,000.00, you may elect to have
                        Phonico pay for the costs invoiced by the selected arbitration provider
                        (“Arbitration Costs”). To the extent otherwise required by applicable
                        law, the Arbitration Rules, or as required of Phonico to enforce the ADR
                        Process, Phonico will pay for or reimburse Arbitration Costs. Otherwise,
                        Phonico and you will equally share the payment of Arbitration Costs. The
                        term Arbitration Costs does not include attorney’s fees incurred by you
                        or Phonico. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief
                        that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory
                        relief and attorneys’ fees.&nbsp;Puerto Rico&nbsp;customers:&nbsp;Refer

                        requests for production of documents and materials, including any
                        electronically stored information, reasonably tailored to the issues in
                        the case, given the Arbitrator’s discretion to limit the production of
                        electronically stored information or shift the cost to the party seeking
                        the production of electronically stored information, depending on the
                        circumstances presented to the Arbitrator. The purpose of this provision
                        is to ensure that the arbitration process is more affordable than an
                        action in Court and that you are not dissuaded from bringing a
                        legitimate claim based on the broader range of discovery permitted in a
                        court action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Arbitrator will have
                        discretion, upon a showing of good cause and necessity to ensure a fair
                        hearing on the merits, to expand the limits of discovery to include
                        additional depositions, additional document requests, or expanded to
                        include written interrogatories in lieu of additional depositions.

                        are not renewable and you must become a paid subscriber to the Phonico
                        service in order to continue your access to the Phonico service. For
                        certain Trial Plans, you may only be able to transfer your mobile phone
                        number from your existing carrier when you purchase a standard Phonico
                        service plan; for these Trial Plans you will instead be assigned a
                        temporary mobile phone number. Upon converting a Trial Plan to a
                        standard Phonico service plan, you may choose either to keep the
                        temporary mobile phone number or to transfer your mobile phone number
                        from your existing carrier. Visit our website located at phonico.com for
                        specific details. If you have activated any Trial Plan, you will not be
                        able to transfer the temporary phone number associated with that Trial
                        Plan to a new carrier unless you convert your Trial Plan to a three,
                        six, or twelve month plan. For all other Phonico service plans, airtime
                        expiration is subject to the terms of your plan. Your account may be
                        canceled for any violation of these T&amp;Cs or the Acceptable Use
                        Policy, or if the following occurs: (1) your airtime has expired (e.g.,
                        after 90 days on any 3-month plan) without a successful renewal payment,
                        which places you in suspended status, and (2) you have not successfully
                        paid for any plan renewal for 60 days or more while in suspended status.
                        Upon cancellation for any reason, we may reassign the phone number
                        associated with your account, and you may be unable to transfer that
                        number to a different carrier. To ensure uninterrupted service, you are
                        required to renew your account before your airtime expires. Please visit

                        &nbsp;All Phonico Service plans are measured on 30-day monthly cycles
                        (including for purposes of determining your data usage levels, as
                        described below in Section 8.6), except that 12-month plans may be
                        measured on 30-day and/or 31-day cycles, for a maximum of 365 days
                        total. We may offer you the opportunity to set up automatic payments
                        through the method of payment on your account, which payments will be
                        automatically charged at the end of your applicable payment cycle (“Auto
                        Renew”). When you enroll in Auto Renew, automatic payments for plan fees
                        that you incur will continue until you cancel. The recurring charge may
                        vary if you change your plan or we change our prices, following notice
                        to you. You may cancel Auto Renew or review your payment preferences at
                        any time by (i) contacting our customer service department at (800)

                        website. You must change your Auto Renew preferences or cancel 24 hours
                        prior to the end of your payment cycle in order for the change to go
                        into effect. No minimum purchase is necessary to enroll in Auto Renew.
                        For disputed charges, see Section 11. You agree to provide us with
                        accurate and complete payment information and to immediately report to

                        to the next full minute. Airtime usage is measured from the time our
                        network supplier begins to process a call (before the phone rings or the
                        call is answered) through its termination of the call (after you hang

                        </em>
                        Phonico has set a monthly (30-day or 31-day, depending on the plan
                        purchased; see above Section 8.2 for explanation of monthly cycles) 5G
                        and/or 4G LTE data usage level (“Usage Level”) for each of the Phonico
                        Service plans. 5G and/or 4G LTE access requires a capable device and SIM
                        within an appropriate coverage area. Actual availability, speed, and
                        coverage may vary. Data for personal use in U.S. only. Our network
                        supplier measures your upload and download data usage (“Actual Usage”)
                        to determine if your total Actual Usage, as aggregated over the
                        applicable 30-day or 31-day period (“Usage Total”), exceeds the 30-day
                        or 31-day Usage Level for the Service plan you selected, at which point
                        you may be unable to send and receive data (which may prevent you from
                        sending or receiving MMS messages) over the Phonico network until the
                        end of the applicable 30-day or 31-day period, except to the extent you
                        purchase a data add-on. Partial megabytes are rounded up. Please note
                        that “Actual Usage” includes all of your requests to upload or download
                        data, whether or not such data is actually uploaded or downloaded, as
                        well as network overhead. For example, if you request that an image be
                        downloaded to your Device or your Mobile HotSpot (tethering), but travel
                        outside of your network coverage area before the download is complete,
                        such request will be included in your Actual Usage even though the image
                        was never downloaded. The amount of high-speed data available for Mobile
                        HotSpot (tethering) available for any 30-day or 31-day Service period is
                        limited to 5GB for Unlimited plan. If you purchased an Unlimited Service
                        plan and you exceed your Service plan’s 30-day or 31-day Usage Level of
                        35GB of 5G and/or 4G LTE data, Phonico or its network supplier will
                        reduce the speed at which you can send and receive data over the Phonico
                        network until the end of the applicable 30-day or 31-day period, except
                        to the extent you purchase a data add-on. Certain data-intensive
                        activities including but not limited to online gaming, file
                        downloads/uploads, and video streaming, may be limited and/or
                        inaccessible on network after data is reduced after 35GB on Unlimited
                        Service plans. For all Service plans, Phonico’s network supplier may
                        also reduce speeds during times of network congestion.&nbsp; Once you
                        begin a new 30-day or 31-day period in your Service plan, your Service
                        plan Usage Level will be reset and your upload and download speeds will
                        be restored, subject to all limitations listed in these T&amp;Cs
                        (including, but not limited to, to the Data Usage Level limitations
                        listed herein, 5G and/or 4G LTE network availability, a capable device
                        and SIM within an appropriate coverage area, and the actual network
                        speeds of Phonico’s network supplier). Please be aware that your Usage
                        Level is much more likely to exceed your Service plan’s 30-day or 31-day
                        Usage Level if you use streaming video and/or a Mobile HotSpot
                        (tethering), if you download significant quantities of music files,
                        movies, and/or software applications, and/or if you engage in other
                        high-bandwidth activities.

                        for the majority of our customers and minimize capacity issues and
                        degradation in network performance, we or our network supplier may take
                        measures including temporarily reducing data throughput for a subset of
                        customers who use a disproportionate amount of bandwidth. If you use
                        your Data Plan in a manner that could interfere with other customers’
                        service, affect our ability to allocate network capacity among
                        customers, or degrade service quality for other customers, we or our
                        network supplier may suspend, terminate, or restrict your data session,
                        prioritize on-Device over Mobile HotSpot (tethering) traffic, or switch
                        you to a more appropriate Data Plan which may result in an increased
                        cost. We or our network supplier also manage the network to facilitate
                        the proper functioning of services that require consistent high speeds,
                        such as video calling, which may, particularly at times and in areas of
                        network congestion, result in reduced speeds for other services.
                        Additionally, we or our network supplier may implement other network
                        management practices, such as caching less data, using less capacity,
                        sizing video more appropriately for a Device to transmit data files more
                        efficiently, and deploying streaming video optimization technology.
                        Streaming video optimization technology is intended to manage data usage
                        on the network, reduce the risk of streaming video stalling and
                        buffering, and reduce the amount of high-speed data consumption used for
                        streaming video. Streaming video optimization improves streaming video
                        reliability as well as makes room for other users to enjoy higher
                        browsing speeds. The streaming video optimization process is agnostic as
                        to the streaming video content itself and to the website that provides
                        it, however, we or our network supplier may prioritize on-Device data
                        over Mobile HotSpot (tethering) data. While most changes to streaming
                        video files are likely to be indiscernible, the optimization process may
                        minimally impact the appearance of the streaming video as displayed on
                        your Device. These practices operate without regard to the content
                        itself or the source of the content, and do not discriminate against
                        offerings that might compete against those offered by us on the basis of
                        such competition.

                    Although added to the overall charge, the Recovery Fee is separate from

                    10.2&nbsp;<em>Federal Universal Service Fund Fee.</em>&nbsp;The Federal
                    Universal Service Fund Fee is designed to recover Phonico’s contribution
                    to the Federal Universal Service Fund program. The Federal Universal
                    Service Fund Fee is used to fund programs to increase access to advanced
                    telecommunications services for consumers in rural areas at reasonable
                    rates and provides federal program funding. Rate may change as determined
                    by the Federal Communications Commission. The Universal Service
                    Administrative Company (“USAC”) establishes a quarterly contribution
                    factor, and Phonico charges its customers the then-applicable rate charged
                    to Phonico by USAC.

                    Universal Service Fund Fee is designed to recover Phonico’s contribution
                    to various state universal service fund programs. The State Universal
                    Service Fund Fee is assessed as a percentage of intrastate revenues, gross
                    revenues, or as a flat rate per line&nbsp;as set forth by the various
                    state, county or municipal jurisdiction. Certain state agencies establish
                    a quarterly, semi-annual or annual contribution factor, and Phonico may
                    choose to charge its customers to recoup the state universal service fund
                    fees charged to Phonico.

                    10.4&nbsp;<em>Sales and Use Taxes.</em>&nbsp;Sales and use taxes are

                    municipal, local or other governmental sales and use taxes now in force or
                    enacted in the future, that arise as a result of your subscription to, use
                    of, or payment for Phonico Service. To determine sales and use taxes, we
                    will use the street address on file. If a credit card address is not on
                    file, then we will use the ZIP code you entered upon activation of the
                    Service. If activation ZIP code does not exist, then we will default to
                    the ZIP code of Phonico’s headquarters: 92626. The address on file for
                    Puerto Rico customers must be in Puerto Rico. If you did not identify the
                    correct address, or if you provided an address (such as a PO box) that is
                    not a recognized street address, does not identify the applicable taxing
                    jurisdictions or does not reflect the Service area associated with your
                    telephone number, you may be assigned the above described ZIP code for tax
                    purposes. In the event of a disputed tax jurisdiction location being
                    assigned, any tax refund must be requested within sixty (60) days of our
                    notification to you that the tax has been assessed.

                    Determination of the applicable 9-1-1 charges depends on where you
                    purchase Phonico Service.&nbsp; Phonico may bill its customers for 9-1-1

                    We do not warrant any device for merchantability or fitness for a

                        A waiver of any part of the Agreement in one instance is not a waiver of
                        any other part or any other instance and must be expressly provided in
                        writing. If we do not enforce our rights under any provisions of the
                        Agreement, we may still require strict compliance in the future. Except
                        as provided in Section 2, if any part of the Agreement is held invalid
                        that part may be severed from the Agreement. You cannot assign the
                        Agreement or any of your rights or duties under it without our written
                        consent. We may assign all or part of the Agreement or your debts to us

                        cannot rely on any other documents or statements by any sales or service

                        made by us pursuant to this Agreement, shall be in our sole reasonable
                        discretion. Sections 2-3, 5, 8-14, and 16-22 of this Agreement continue

                    etc.). For avoidance of all doubt, in addition to all other terms and
